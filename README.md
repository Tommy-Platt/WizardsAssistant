# Welcome to _Wizards Assistant_ ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Prebuild for your OS

   ```bash
    npx expo prebuild
   ```

4. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

In order for _Wizards Assistant_ to work correctly from this unbuilt version, you must run it as a **development build**.
This means that **Expo Go** WILL NOT allow you to run the application.

## Happy gaming!
